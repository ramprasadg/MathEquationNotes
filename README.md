# MathEquationNotes
An easy and convenient way to digitally preserve notes that contain Mathematical Equations.

# Why & How solve this problem ?
I was taking a class on [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) (which I highly recommend). I wanted to take notes digitally. I found it tedious to manually type the equations. When I started searching for a solution I came across [Mathpix](http://mathpix.com/) . It was exactly the kind of thing I wanted, But for a desktop platform.

My reason to learn linear algebra was actually to learn machine learning. Now I feel that I have found a problem on which I can focus on and I build this project I hope to learn more about Image Processing, Computer Vision, Linear Algebra, Neural Networks.

# What is the end goal ?
I not only want a working solution to my note taking problem, I also want to document the processes, successes and failures along the way. I want this repo to be a guide to anyone who wants to learn how to learn, think and solve these problems.
